*Before* submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done...

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from the **latest** `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
3. If you've changed APIs, describe what needs to be updated in the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`go test`).
5. Make sure your code lints (`go fmt && go vet`).
