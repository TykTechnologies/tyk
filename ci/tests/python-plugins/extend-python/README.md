### Tyk Gateway with Python Coprocess

Starting from Tyk Gateway version `v5.3.0`, Python is no longer bundled with the official Docker images. 
However, Tyk Gateway continues to support Python coprocess functionality. 

If you wish to use Python coprocess, you can extend the official Docker image by adding Python to it. This directory contains a sample Dockerfile that demonstrates how to achieve this.
