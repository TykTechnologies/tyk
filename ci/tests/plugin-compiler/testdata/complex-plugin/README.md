# Complex plugin

This location serves as a more complex plugin that has self-referencing
import paths. The import paths get replaced in plugin compiler.

It's a structural rewrite of `../basic-plugin` and adds no new functionality.

For more details about the test case, run `task` in parent folder, or
cross reference with the implementation of plugin_id in plugin compiler.
