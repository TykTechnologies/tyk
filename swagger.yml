  title: Tyk Gateway API
  version: 2.8.0
  description: |-
    The Tyk Gateway REST API is the primary means for integrating your application with the Tyk API Gateway system. This API is very small, and has no granular permissions system. It is intended to be used purely for internal automation and integration.

    **Warning: Under no circumstances should outside parties be granted access to this API.**

    The Tyk Gateway API is capable of:

    * Managing session objects (token generation)
    * Managing and listing policies
    * Managing and listing API Definitions (only when not using the Dashboard)
    * Hot reloads / reloading a cluster configuration
    * OAuth client creation (only when not using the Dashboard)

    In order to use the REST API, you울ll need to set the `secret` parameter in your tyk.conf file.

    The shared secret you set should then be sent along as a header with each REST API Request in order for it to be successful:

    ```
    x-tyk-authorization: <your-secret>
    ```
    <br/>
    <b>The Tyk Gateway API is subsumed by the Tyk Dashboard API in Pro installations.</b>

      All keys that are used to access services via Tyk correspond to a session object that informs Tyk about the context of this particular token, like access rules and rate/quota allowance.

      Additionally see <a href="https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-rest-api/token-session-object-details/">key session object data format</a>.

      Sometimes a cache might contain stale data, or it may just need to be cleared because of an invalid configuration. This call will purge all keys associated with a cache on an API-by-API basis.

  - name: Organisation Quotas
    description: |-
      It is possible to force API quota and rate limit across all keys that belong to a specific organisation ID. Rate limiting on an organisation level is useful for creating tiered access levels and trial accounts.
      The Organisation rate limiting middleware works with both Quotas and Rate Limiters. In order to manage this functionality, a simple API has been put in place to manage these sessions.
      Although the Organisation session-limiter uses the same session object, all other security keys are optional as they are not used.

      <h3>Managing active status</h3>
      To disallow access to an entire group of keys without rate limiting the organisation, create a session object with the "is_inactive" key set to true, this will block access before any other middleware is executed. This is useful when managing subscriptions for an organisation group and access needs to be blocked because of non-payment.
  - name: Batch requests
    description: |-
      Tyk supports batch requests, so a client makes a single request to the API but gets a compound response object back.

      This is especially handy if clients have complex requests that have multiple synchronous dependencies and do not wish to have the entire request / response cycle running for each event.

      See <a href="https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-rest-api/batch-requests/">detailed guide</a>

      **Note: Applies only to Tyk Gateway Community Edition**

      API Management is very simple using the Tyk REST API: each update only affects the underlying file, and this endpoint will only work with disk based installations, not Database-backed ones.

      API's that are added this way are flushed to to disk into the app_path folder using the format: `{api-id}.json`. Updating existing API's that use a different naming convention will cause those API's to be added, which could subsequently lead to a loading error and crash if they use the same listen_path.

      These methods only work on a single API node. If updating a cluster, it is important to ensure that all nodes are updated before initiating a reload.

        Updating an API definition uses the same signature an object as a `POST`, however it will first ensure that the API ID that is being updated is the same as the one in the object being `PUT`.


        Updating will completely replace the file descriptor and will not change an API Definition that has already been loaded, the hot-reload endpoint will need to be called to push the new definition to live.

        API keys without access_rights data will be written to all APIs on the system (this also means that they will be created across all SessionHandlers and StorageHandlers, it is recommended to always embed access_rights data in a key to ensure that only targeted APIs and their back-ends are written to.

      summary: Create new OAuth client
      description: Any oAuth keys must be generated with the help of a client ID. These need to be pre-registered with Tyk before they can be used (in a similar vein to how you would register your app with Twitter before attempting to ask user permissions using their API).
        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Creating OAuth clients with Access to Multiple APIs</h3>
        New for Tyk Gateway 2.6.0 is the ability to create OAuth clients with access to more than one API. If you provide the api_id it works the same as in previous releases. If you don울t provide the api_id the request uses policy access rights and enumerates APIs from their setting in the newly created OAuth-client.
