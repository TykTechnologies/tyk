  title: Tyk Gateway API
  version: 5.3.8
  description: |-
    The Tyk Gateway API is the primary means for integrating your application with the Tyk API Gateway system. This API is very small, and has no granular permissions system. It is intended to be used purely for internal automation and integration.

    **Warning: Under no circumstances should outside parties be granted access to this API.**

    The Tyk Gateway API is capable of:

    * Managing session objects (key generation)
    * Managing and listing policies
    * Managing and listing API Definitions (only when not using the Dashboard)
    * Hot reloads / reloading a cluster configuration
    * OAuth client creation (only when not using the Dashboard)


    In order to use the Gateway API, you'll need to set the `secret` parameter in your tyk.conf file.

    The shared secret you set should then be sent along as a header with each Gateway API Request in order for it to be successful:

    ```
    x-tyk-authorization: <your-secret>
    ```
    <br/>
    <b>The Tyk Gateway API is subsumed by the Tyk Dashboard API in Pro installations.</b>

      All keys that are used to access services via Tyk correspond to a session object that informs Tyk about the context of this particular token, like access rules and rate/quota allowance.
  - name: Policies
    description: |-
      A Tyk security policy incorporates several security options that can be applied to an API key. It acts as a template that can override individual sections of an API key (or identity) in Tyk.

      Sometimes a cache might contain stale data, or it may just need to be cleared because of an invalid configuration. This call will purge all keys associated with a cache on an API-by-API basis.

  - name: Organisation Quotas
    description: |-
      It is possible to force API quota and rate limit across all keys that belong to a specific organisation ID. Rate limiting at an organisation level is useful for creating tiered access levels and trial accounts.
      The Organisation rate limiting middleware works with both Quotas and Rate Limiters. In order to manage this functionality, a simple API has been put in place to manage these sessions.
      Although the Organisation session-limiter uses the same session object, all other security keys are optional as they are not used.

      <h3>Managing active status</h3>
      To disallow access to an entire group of keys without rate limiting the organisation, create a session object with the "is_inactive" key set to true. This will block access before any other middleware is executed. It is useful when managing subscriptions for an organisation group and access needs to be blocked because of non-payment.
  - name: Batch requests
    description: |-
      Tyk supports batch requests, so a client makes a single request to the API but gets a compound response object back.

      This is especially handy if clients have complex requests that have multiple synchronous dependencies and do not wish to have the entire request / response cycle running for each event.

      To enable batch request support, set the `enable_batch_request_support` value to `true`

      This is especially handy if clients have complex requests that have multiple synchronous dependencies and do not wish to have the entire request / response cycle running for each event.

      Batch requests that come into Tyk are *run through the whole Tyk machinery* and *use a relative path to prevent spamming*. This means that a batch request to Tyk for three resources with the same API key will have three requests applied to their session quota and request limiting could become active if they are being throttled.

      Tyk reconstructs the API request based on the data in the batch request. This is to ensure that Tyk is not being used to proxy requests to other hosts outside of the upstream API being accessed.

      Batch requests are created by POSTing to the `/{listen_path}/tyk/batch/` endpoint. These requests **do not require a valid key**, but their request list does.

      <h3>Sample Request</h3>

        ```{json}
        {
          "requests": [
            {
              "method": "GET",
              "headers": {
                "x-tyk-test": "1",
                "x-tyk-version": "1.2",
                "authorization": "1dbc83b9c431649d7698faa9797e2900f"
              },
              "body": "",
              "relative_url": "get"
          },
          {
            "method": "GET",
            "headers": {
              "x-tyk-test": "2",
              "x-tyk-version": "1.2",
              "authorization": "1dbc83b9c431649d7698faa9797e2900f"
            },
            "body": "",
            "relative_url": "get"
            }
          ],
          "suppress_parallel_execution": false
        }
        ```

      The response will will be a structured reply that encapsulates the responses for each of the outbound requests. If `suppress_parallel_execution` is set to `true`, requests will be made synchronously. If set to `false` then they will run in parallel and the response order is not guaranteed.

          }
      ]
      ```
      With the body for each request string encoded in the `body` field.

      * `expire_analytics_after`: If you are running a busy API, you may want to ensure that your MongoDB database does not overflow with old data. Set the `expire_analytics_after` value to the number of seconds you would like the data to last for. Setting this flag to anything above `0` will set an `expireAt` field for each record that is written to the database.

      **Important:** Tyk will not create the expiry index for you. In order to implement data expiry for your analytics data, ensure that the index is created This is easily achieved using the [MongoDB command line interface](https://docs.mongodb.com/getting-started/shell/client/).

      * `dont_set_quota_on_create`: This setting defaults to `false`, but if set to `true`, when the API is used to edit, create or add keys, the quota cache in Redis will not be re-set. By default, all updates or creates to Keys that have Quotas set will re-set the quota (This has been the default behaviour since 1.0).

        This behaviour can be bypassed on a case-by-case basis by using the `suppress_reset` parameter when making a REST API request. This is the advised mode of operation as it allows for manual, granular control over key quotas and reset timings.

      * `cache_options`: This section enables you to configure the caching behaviour of Tyk and to enable or disable the caching middleware for your API.

      * `cache_options.enable_cache`: Set this value to `true` if the cache should be enabled for this endpoint, setting it to false will stop all caching behaviour.

      * `cache_options.cache_timeout`: The amount of time, in seconds, to keep cached objects, defaults to `60` seconds.

      * `cache_options.cache_all_safe_requests`: Set this to `true` if you want all *safe* requests (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS) to be cached. This is a blanket setting for APIs where caching is required but you don't want to set individual paths up in the definition.
      
      * `cache_options.enable_upstream_cache_control`: Set this to `true` if you want your application to control the cache options for Tyk (TTL and whether to cache or not). See [Caching](/docs/basic-config-and-security/reduce-latency/caching/) for more details.
      
      * `response_processors`: Response processors need to be specifically defined so they are loaded on API creation, otherwise the middleware will not fire. In order to have the two main response middleware components fire, the following configuration object should be supplied.

      ```{json}
      "response_processors": [
        {
            "name": "header_injector",
            "options": {
                "add_headers": {"name": "value"},
                "remove_headers": ["name"]
            }
        },
        {
          "name": "response_body_transform",
          "options": {}
        }
      ]
      ```
      The options for the `header_injector` are global, and will apply to all outbound requests.

      **Note: Applies only to Tyk Gateway Community Edition**

      API Management is very simple using the Tyk REST API: each update only affects the underlying file, and this endpoint will only work with disk based installations, not Database-backed ones.

      APIs that are added this way are flushed to to disk into the app_path folder using the format: `{api-id}.json`. Updating existing APIs that use a different naming convention will cause those APIs to be added, which could subsequently lead to a loading error and crash if they use the same listen_path.

      These methods only work on a single API node. If updating a cluster, it is important to ensure that all nodes are updated before initiating a reload.

        Updating an API definition uses the same signature an object as a `POST`, however it will first ensure that the API ID that is being updated is the same as the one in the object being `PUT`.


        Updating will completely replace the file descriptor and will not change an API Definition that has already been loaded, the hot-reload endpoint will need to be called to push the new definition to live.

        Tyk will generate the access token based on the OrgID specified in the API Definition and a random UUID. This ensures that keys can be "owned" by different API Owners should segmentation be needed at an organisational level.

        API keys without access_rights data will be written to all APIs on the system (this also means that they will be created across all SessionHandlers and StorageHandlers, it is recommended to always embed access_rights data in a key to ensure that only targeted APIs and their back-ends are written to.

      summary: Create Custom Key / Import Key
      description: |-
        You can use the `POST /tyk/keys/{KEY_ID}` endpoint as defined below to import existing keys into Tyk.

        This example uses standard `authorization` header authentication, and assumes that the Gateway is located at `127.0.0.1:8080` and the Tyk secret is `352d20ee67be67f6340b4c0605b044b7` - update these as necessary to match your environment.

        To import a key called `mycustomkey`, save the JSON contents as `token.json` (see example below), then run the following Curl command.

        ```
        curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/tyk/keys/mycustomkey -H 'x-tyk-authorization: 352d20ee67be67f6340b4c0605b044b7' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d @token.json
        ```

        The following request will fail as the key doesn't exist.

        ```
        curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/quickstart/headers -H 'Authorization. invalid123'
        ```

        But this request will now work, using the imported key.

        ```
        curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/quickstart/headers -H 'Authorization: mycustomkey'
        ```

        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Creating OAuth clients with Access to Multiple APIs</h3>
        New from Tyk Gateway 2.6.0 is the ability to create OAuth clients with access to more than one API. If you provide the api_id it works the same as in previous releases. If you don't provide the api_id the request uses policy access rights and enumerates APIs from their setting in the newly created OAuth-client.

        For Gateway v2.6.0 onwards, you can now set rate limits at the organisation level by using the following fields - allowance and rate. These are the number of allowed requests for the specified per value, and need to be set to the same value. If you don't want to have organisation level rate limiting, set `rate` or `per` to zero, or don't add them to your request.
