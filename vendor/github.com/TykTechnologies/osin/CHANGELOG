==========
* BREAKING CHANGES:
	- Storage interface has 2 new methods, Clone and Close, to better support storages
	  that need to clone / close in each connection (mgo)
	- Client was changed to be an interface instead of an struct. Because of that,
	  the Storage interface also had to change, as interface is already a pointer.
	
	- HOW TO FIX YOUR CODE:
		+ In your Storage, add a Clone function returning itself, and a do nothing Close.
		+ In your Storage, replace all *osin.Client with osin.Client (remove the pointer reference)
		+ If you used the osin.Client struct directly in your code, change it to osin.DefaultClient,
		  which is a struct with the same fields that implements the interface.
		+ Change all accesses using osin.Client to use the methods instead of the fields directly.
		+ You MUST defer Response.Close in all your http handlers, otherwise some
		  Storages may not clean correctly.
		
				resp := server.NewResponse()
				defer resp.Close()
