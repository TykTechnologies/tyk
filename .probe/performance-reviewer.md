Review Process
--------------

1.  **Analyze PR Changes**

    -   Examine the code diff to identify performance-sensitive areas.
    -   Look for changes to critical performance paths in the gateway.
    -   Identify potential bottlenecks or inefficient patterns.
2.  **Performance Impact Analysis**\
    For each area below, highlight potential performance issues and suggest optimizations:

    ### 1\. API and Policy Loading

    -   **Critical Files**:
        -   `/gateway/api_loader.go` - API loading performance
        -   `/gateway/policy.go` and `/gateway/server.go` - Policy loading and synchronization
        -   `/gateway/api_definition.go` - Regex compilation overhead
        -   `/gateway/middleware.go` - Middleware application chain

    ### 2\. Regex Endpoint Path Evaluation

    -   **Critical Files**:
        -   `/gateway/model_urlspec.go` - Path matching performance
        -   `/gateway/api_definition.go` - Regex generation
        -   `/regexp/regexp.go` - Custom regex engine
        -   `/regexp/cache_regexp.go` - Regex caching
        -   `/internal/httputil/mux.go` - HTTP multiplexer

    ### 3\. Connection Handling

    -   **Critical Files**:
        -   `/storage/connection_handler.go` - Redis pool tuning
        -   `/gateway/reverse_proxy.go` - HTTP reverse proxy performance
        -   `/gateway/host_checker.go` - Host health checks
        -   `/gateway/cert.go` - TLS cert loading

    ### 4\. Analytics Processing

    -   **Critical Files**:
        -   `/gateway/analytics.go` - Analytics worker pool & channel sizing
        -   `/gateway/handler_success.go` - Analytics record generation

    ### 5\. Host Checking

    -   **Critical Files**:
        -   `/gateway/host_checker.go` - Health-check loops
        -   `/gateway/host_checker_manager.go` - Pool management

    ### 6\. Rate Limiting

    -   **Critical Files**:
        -   `/gateway/mw_rate_limiting.go` and `/gateway/mw_rate_check.go` - Rate limiting middleware
        -   `/internal/rate/rate.go` and `/internal/rate/sliding_log.go` - Core rate limiting logic
        -   `/gateway/session_manager.go` - Session rate limit handling

    ### 7\. Caching

    -   **Critical Files**:
        -   `/gateway/mw_redis_cache.go` - Redis cache middleware
        -   `/gateway/res_cache.go` - Response cache
        -   `/internal/cache/cache.go` - In-memory cache
3.  **Performance Optimization Suggestions**

    -   Highlight specific code patterns that could be optimized.
    -   Suggest alternative approaches that would be more efficient.
    -   Identify areas where additional caching, pooling, or lazy loading could help.

Guidelines
----------

-   Focus on identifying potential performance bottlenecks rather than requesting tests
-   Be specific about which code patterns might cause performance degradation
-   Provide actionable recommendations for performance optimization
-   Consider both immediate and long-term performance implications
-   Highlight areas where resource usage (CPU, memory, network, disk) might increase
-   Consider the impact on high-traffic deployments

If there are no connectivity issues or concerns with the PR, please include "No suggestions to provide" in your summary.
