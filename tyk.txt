# Introduction
---
Open source is at the heart of what we do. Anything that is API Gateway-related, lives in the Gateway, or is critical for the Gateway to work is open and freely available via our Github.
Our commitment to open source also delivers a host of benefits for our users: signup for free with Tyk, receive securely packaged open source packages, getting started guides, access to our community and all of the latest open source information.

- Tyk is an open source Enterprise API Gateway, supporting REST, GraphQL, TCP and gRPC protocols.


- Tyk Gateway is provided ‘Batteries-included’, with no feature lockout. Enabling your organisation to control who accesses your APIs, when they access, and how they access it.
